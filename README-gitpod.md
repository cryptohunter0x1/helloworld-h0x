# Hello world on Solana (Gitpod version)

This project demonstrates how to use the [Solana Javascript
API](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) to build, deploy, and
interact with programs on the Solana blockchain.

The project comprises of:

* An on-chain hello world program
* A client that can send a "hello" to an account and get back the number of
  times "hello" has been sent

## Quick Start

Using this example in Gitpod connects to the public Solana `devnet` cluster. Use
the environment variable `CLUSTER` to choose a different Solana cluster.

Start a local Solana cluster:
```bash
solana-test-validator
```

Deploy the on-chain program:
```bash
solana program deploy ./dist/program/helloworld.so
```

Run the client to load and interact with the on-chain program:
```bash
npm run start
```

The remaining sections of this document point back to the non-Gitpod version of
the README for more information.
